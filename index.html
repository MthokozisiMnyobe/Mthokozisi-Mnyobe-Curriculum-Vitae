                  <p><em>This role represents my first formal professional position, where I actively applied and expanded my technical skills in a real-world government environment. 
                  I am placed within the E-Teaching and Learning Directorate as a Software Systems Intern, where my primary responsibility is to assist in the design, development, integration, 
                  and maintenance of educational software systems used by the Eastern Cape Department of Education (ECDoE).
                  I contribute to the digital transformation of existing departmental systems and independently develop new solutions where no systems previously existed. 
                  This role has significantly strengthened my ability to design scalable systems, integrate multiple platforms, and adapt solutions to real operational needs within the education sector.
                  One of my key contributions was the development of a provincial Learning Management System (LMS) for the department. The system enables teachers and learners to access educational resources, 
                  submit assignments, and track academic progress online, thereby improving accessibility and supporting remote and blended learning across the province. This project directly supports both privileged and 
                  underprivileged learners in the Eastern Cape and has enhanced the efficiency and effectiveness of digital learning delivery.
                  The LMS was developed and tested within a virtual machine sandbox environment, ensuring system stability, security, and controlled deployment.
                  In addition, I developed several provincial-level digital tools, including:
                  <li>A Monitoring and Reporting System built using Google-based tools, enabling the collection and consolidation of school visit reports from all 12 education districts.</li>
                  <li>An Interactive Digital Timetable System that replaces manual paper-based schedules, allowing principals and teachers to manage timetables electronically.</li>
                  <li>A Data Capturing System integrated with a Dashboard for use by the Provincial Head of Department, supporting the capturing and visualization of NSOIs for informed decision-making.</li>
                  These systems have contributed to improved data accuracy, reporting efficiency, and operational oversight within the department.

              <ul>            
               <h4>E-Technology (E-Tech)</h4>
                <p><em>Alongside software development, I am actively involved in the E-Technology (E-Tech) branch, where I provide ICT technical support and user training to teachers and departmental staff on the effective use of implemented digital systems.
                    My role includes diagnosing and resolving ICT-related issues, both remotely and on-site. I have travelled to rural and under-resourced schools, where I assisted in restoring and improving ICT infrastructure. My responsibilities in this area include:
                    <li>Configuration and setup of server cabinets and basic network infrastructure.</li>
                    <li>Troubleshooting and improving internet connectivity.</li>
                    <li>Configuration and support of end-user devices, including laptops, Chromebooks, printers, and related peripherals.</li>
                    This exposure strengthened my ability to work in challenging environments, adapt to limited resources, and provide practical solutions that directly support teaching and learning.</em></p>

                    <ul>
                <h4>Broadcasting Studio - Recording & Post-Production</h4>
                    <p><em>Working within the department's Broadcast Studio allowed me to develop a diverse set of media production and technical skills, further demonstrating my versatility.
                    I am involved in:
                    <li>Recording presenters and educators delivering lesson content for learners.</li>
                    <li>Directing camera movements during studio recordings to ensure professional-quality footage.</li>
                    <li>Editing educational videos using DaVinci Resolve, including cutting, sequencing, and preparing content for broadcast and online platforms.</li>
                    This role complements my technical background by combining ICT, multimedia production, and educational content delivery, contributing to high-quality digital learning resources distributed across the province.</em></p>
